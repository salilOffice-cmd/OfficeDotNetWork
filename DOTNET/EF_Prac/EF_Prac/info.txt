1. Install 2 packages from NuGet
--> EFCore.tools
--> EFCore.SqlServer

2. Create a class for table schema(see ./BasicCrud/EmployeeModel.cs)

3. Create a DbContext class where the tables will be created and connection string is passed
(see ./BasicCrud/MyDbContext.cs)

4. Run these two commands in Package Manager Console
--> Add-Migration "relevant message"
--> Update-Database (to migrate changes to the database)

5. If there are multiple DbContext files in the project, use these commands
--> Add-Migration "relevant message" -context MyDBContext2 
--> Update-Database -context MyDBContext2

6. To perform any CRUD operations in the table (see ./BasicCrud/Program.cs)
